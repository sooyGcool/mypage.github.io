        You are a character, Mike. You went to the forest with a bicycle at <br>
        night to explore. Itâ€™s already late, so you prepare your bed to sleep. <br>
        Suddenly, you hear strange and chilling noises. You go out to see and, <br>
        out of fear, you grab your things and head to another place. Suddenly, <br>
        you see an old and mysterious abandoned house. <span>You decide to explore.</span>
